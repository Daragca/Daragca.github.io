			<h2 id="section1">About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm an eighteen year old, aspiring fullstack web developer. Currently dedicated to<br>
			learning new skills as I work towards a desired career change. I am using ITCareerSwitch as a tool<br>
			to help me do this, alongside the codecademy course that has given me this website <br>
			as a project to complete. <br><br>
			I'm enjoying coding so far and the challenge that it is presenting me with. I'm looking <br>
			forward to where it can take me and what websites will eventually be able to build.

					<h3><u>Fotomatic</u></h3>
					<p>In this project I edited pre-existing code to complete both bug-fixes and<br>
					turning the website from desktop only to a responsive site.<br>
					This was completed with the use of media queries and implemented<br>
					CSS Flexbox alongside to ensure that images could shrink and grow <br>
					alongside the veiwport's dimensions.</p>

					<h3><u>The Tea Cozy</u></h3>
					<p>This project was build from scratch and followed a set of <br>
					guidelines in order to reach the final project. With this project<br>
					I worked with using a red-line model and problem solved to come up with a<br>
					solution. I encorperated both CSS Flexbox and Grid to make my site work.</p>
